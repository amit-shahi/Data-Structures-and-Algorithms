# Space & Time Complexity for Doubly Linked List

## Searching - 
 O(n) time -  Just searching for a node by traversing the entire linked list | 
 O(1) space - Not storing anything other than current Node, because pointer points to different Node

## Removing One Item
 O(1) time | O(1) space

## Removing Two or More Item
 O(n) time | O(1) time

## SetHead(), SetTail(), insertBefore(), insertAfter()
 O(1) time | O(1) space

## insertAtPosition(), 
 O(p) time -- Because we have to traverse all the way to the position |
 O(1) space
